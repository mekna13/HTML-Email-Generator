        "event_description": "This workshop helps participants enhance their teaching and public speaking skills through microteaching demonstrations delivered in a low-risk environment. Each participant delivers a 5-minute presentation, receiving constructive feedback from a consultant and an undergraduate student on pronunciation, presentation structure, visual aids, nonverbal communication and more. By presenting in front of a friendly audience, participants develop confidence, and by observing peers\u2019 presentations, they gain additional insight into best practices for comprehensible and well-developed presentations.\n\nLearning Outcomes: \nParticipants will be able to\u2026\n1. Construct and deliver short, well-structured and intelligible presentations.\n2. Create a visual aid to support key points.\n3. Identify areas for improvement in their own presentations and those of their peers."
